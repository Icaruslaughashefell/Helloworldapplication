simply just fault in our star lyrics

The weight
Of a simple human emotion weighs me down
More than the tank ever did
The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm okay
And I I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you
And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see see the stars with you
You lost
A part of your existence in the war
Against yourself
Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go
And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you
And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you
Don't give it up just yet stay grand for
One more minute
Don't give it up just yet stay grand
Oh don't give it up just yet stay grand for
One more minute
Don't give it up just yet stay grand
Oh don't give it up just yet stay grand for
One more minute
Don't give it up just yet stay grand
And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you
And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you
With you
